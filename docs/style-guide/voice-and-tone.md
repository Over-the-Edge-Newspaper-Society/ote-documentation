## Voice Checklist

Before publishing, ask:

- [ ] Does this sound like Over the Edge?
- [ ] Is the tone appropriate for the content type?
- [ ] Would our community find this respectful and helpful?
- [ ] Have we used inclusive, accessible language?
- [ ] Is our perspective clear but fair?
- [ ] Does this serve our community's need for information?

## Examples in Practice

### Strong Voice Example
> The proposed bike lane project has divided the community, with business owners expressing concerns about parking loss while cycling advocates argue for safer transportation options. The city council will consider both perspectives at Thursday's public hearing.

**Why this works**: Presents both sides fairly, uses clear language, focuses on community impact, provides actionable information.

### Weak Voice Example
> There's a huge controversy brewing over the bike lane thing, with people really upset on both sides. It's a total mess and nobody seems happy about anything.

**Problems**: Vague language, sensationalizes conflict, doesn't provide useful information, unprofessional tone.

*Remember: Our voice should serve our community by providing clear, fair, and helpful information. When in doubt, choose clarity and respect over cleverness.*
