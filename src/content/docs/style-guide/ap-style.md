## Key AP Style Rules

### Addresses
- Abbreviate Ave., Blvd., St. in numbered addresses

### Capitalization
- Capitalize proper nouns and formal titles before names
- **Example**: President Biden, but Biden is president
- Lowercase directions unless part of proper name

### Dates & Times

- **Example**: Oct. 15, 2024, not October 15th, 2024
- Use a.m. and p.m. (lowercase with periods)
- Days of the week: Spell out, don't abbreviate in text

### Money

- For large amounts: $1 million, $2.5 billion
- Spell out amounts under $1 million in casual references

### Numbers
- Spell out one through nine, use figures for 10 and above
- **Exception**: Use figures for ages, percentages, scores
- Use commas for numbers 1,000 and above

### Percentages
- Use figures: 5 percent, not five percent

## Publication-Specific Style Preferences

### Over the Edge Specific Guidelines

## Common AP Style Errors to Avoid

### Incorrect → Correct
- ❌ more than vs. over → ✅ Use "more than" for numbers, "over" for spatial relationships
- ❌ since vs. because → ✅ Use "since" for time, "because" for causation
- ❌ farther vs. further → ✅ "Farther" for distance, "further" for degree
- ❌ that vs. which → ✅ "That" for essential clauses, "which" for nonessential
- ❌ who vs. whom → ✅ "Who" for subjects, "whom" for objects

### Punctuation
- **Commas**: Use serial comma in lists (Oxford comma)
- **Hyphens**: Use for compound adjectives (well-known author)
- **Apostrophes**: Use for possession and contractions, not plurals
- **Quotation marks**: American style (commas and periods inside)
